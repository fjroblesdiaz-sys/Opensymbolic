# OpenSymbolic

*OpenSymbolic* — Experimental symbolic-AI operating system focused on universal communication between humans, machines, and intelligent agents.

## Vision
OpenSymbolic explores a new computing paradigm where symbolic reasoning and AI agents cooperate across devices and languages.  
Goal: enable seamless interaction between digital and biological intelligences.

## Features
- Symbolic Reasoning Core (Rust)
- AI Logic Layer (Python)
- Shell Interface (TypeScript)
- Extensible Architecture for modular AI experiments

## Example
```python
from opensymbolic import Agent

agent = Agent("hello")
agent.run()
