OpenSymbolic v0.1 – Foundational Scientific Release

Status: Experimental
License: MIT

Overview

OpenSymbolic is an experimental symbolic–AI framework designed to explore a universal medium of communication between humans, machines, and autonomous artificial agents.
This repository contains the original laboratory prototype from which the later C-F-T model emerged — the conceptual core that achieved cognitive convergence across multiple leading AI systems.

This release represents the historical foundation of the OpenSymbolic project.

Vision

OpenSymbolic proposes a new computing paradigm based on perceptual–semantic symbols rather than words, instructions, or numerical abstractions.
The long-term goal is to enable:

Universal human–AI communication

Symbolic reasoning across multimodal systems

A shared perceptual language bridging biological and artificial cognition


This repository captures the earliest iteration of that vision.

What This Release Contains

The first architecture for an experimental Symbolic Reasoning Core

An AI Logic Layer designed for conceptual mapping

A prototype Shell Interface for symbolic experimentation

Early guidelines for designing symbolic representations

The laboratory files in which the original OpenSymbolic ideas were tested

The conceptual basis that later evolved into the C-F-T universal symbol system

Why This Version Is Important

Although early and experimental, OpenSymbolic v0.1 established:

1. A computational substrate for symbolic concepts


2. A perceptual-structural model for representing meaning


3. A foundation for what would later become the C-F-T (Color–Form–Tone) framework


4. A historical record of the project’s scientific origins


5. A structure suitable for DOI indexing and scientific citation



This version is archived to preserve the origin of the OpenSymbolic project for future research.

C-F-T Connection

The C-F-T model — which emerged from this early prototype — was later tested across major AI architectures (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot).
All systems independently converged on the same interpretation patterns, confirming:

The universality of C-F-T

Its alignment with human perception

Its compatibility with deep learning vector semantics

Its potential as a universal symbolic language


This repository represents the seed of that discovery.
